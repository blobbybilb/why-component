Framework based on AlpineJS

- I like AlpineJS, but needed components like Svelte
- I like Svelte, but needed something that doesn't require compilation like AlpineJS

Kind of like a library containing the missing features I want in AlpineJS.

Note: this is currently just a quick start on this, it'll probably be rewritten one day.


## Features:
- Components (like in Svelte), done in a very basic way
